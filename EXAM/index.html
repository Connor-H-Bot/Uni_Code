                <p class="text_left_alignment"> 
                    For the main CITS3403 project, my group partner and I created a website called Trumpter. 
                    The website presents you with two tweets each round, where one is authored by Donald Trump, and the other
                    being a random celebrity. These celebrities include Kanye West, Soulja Boy, Ryan Reynolds, ect. <br>
                    <br>
                    So, <span>WHY</span> on earth would we make this? <br>
                    Politics aside, most people would agree that Donald could say some outlandish things. 
                    Now that he's served as a President, all of his tweets are historical documents. 
                    Future generations may come to study some of Trumps writings in textbooks, or whatever platform schools may use to teach students. <br>
                    <br>

                <h1>
                    Overview: Game Rules
                </h1>
                <p class="text_left_alignment"> 
                    -You play 5x rounds, with each round presenting two tweets. One is Trumps, the other is random. <br>
                    -<span>CLICK</span> the tweet you think is Trumps. <br>
                    -In order to win, score 5/5 <br>
                    -A <span>STREAK</span> is formed by getting a win, and can continue as long as the player gets all guesses correct. <br>
                    -A <span>STREAK</span> is broken by getting one or more tweets wrong each game. 
                    -If one of the first four tweets is guessed incorrectly, you have the reset option at the top right to start that game again. <br>
                    -Restarting won't ruin your streak, but it will show you new tweets.

                <p class="text_left_alignment">
                    Trumpter’s client side consists of <span>HTML</span>, <span>Javascript</span>, and <span>CSS</span>. <br>
                    <br>
                    Using <span>HTML</span> for structuring the page, the <span>DOM</span> content is easily modified as required for gameplay. <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>CSS</span> is used to make the website look appealing, while also providing functionality such as animations & 
                    adjusting the placement/sizing of elements depending on the webpage width. <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, <span>JS</span> provides core functionality & game logic. 
                    There’s no <span>JS</span> included in the <span>HTML</span> such as buttons with “onclick()” - 
                    as this is replaced by mouselistener events implemented over DIVs. 
                    <span>JS</span> variables actively hold the score, call new tweets, populate tweets, and manipulate the <span>DOM</span> as needed.  <br>

                    The best alternative presentation theme for Trumpter would be a light mode. <br>

                <p class="text_left_alignment">
                    Trumpters early designs featured this colour scheme, but as both of us preferred dark mode on our browsers 
                    (dark mode is ineffective on files) we opted to create the whole website to be less harsh on the eyes. <br>
                    For Tweets, a pristine white such as rgb(255, 255, 255) would be used in tandem with a grey such as #b9b9b9. 
                    Content outside the tweets would employ a soft off-white colouring and a tasteful thickness on the border/margin lines.

                    Server-side vs Client-side rendering:
                </h4>
                <p class="text_left_alignment">
                    Server-side rendering: <br>
                        ~Advantages~ <br>
                    -Incredibly difficult for users to skew results (compared to modifying the local client JS) <br>
                    -Less content and bandwidth required for users with poor internet connections <br>
                    -Better for SEO (search engine optimisation) <br>
                    -Inner workings of website code are obfuscated. <br>
                        ~Disadvantages~ <br>
                    -Running scripts on your server sucks up resources. In the event of a DDOS or Slowloris attack, this is significantly leveraged
                    making it easier to perform these attacks. <br>
                    -Pages need to be refreshed to show new content, compared to a Javascript DOM manipulation live. 
                </p>
                <p class="text_left_alignment">
                    Client-side rendering: <br>
                        ~Advantages~ <br>
                    -Faster to load a website, and less stress on server side resources <br>
                    -Dynamically update content <br>
                    -Enables tracking of users through techniques such as GPU fingerprinting (timing how long it takes to run a specific Jscript animation) <br>
                        ~Disadvantages~ <br>
                    -Without proper server side checks in place, users can manipulate data that will be sent back to the server (modifying game scores, ect) <br>
                    -Anyone with the ability to press "F12" has the ability to see all of the websites code.

                    The server side architecture is almost entirely built from packages associated with Flask. <br>
                    -A python file dedicated to routes connects webpage requests with the associated content. <br> 
                    -SQLAlchemy allows access to the database, which contains tweets, user data, and accounts. <br>
