                    For the main CITS3403 project, my group partner and I created a website called Trumpter. 
                    The website presents you with two tweets each round, where one is authored by Donald Trump, and the other
                    being a random celebrity. These celebrities include Kanye West, Soulja Boy, Ryan Reynolds, ect. <br>
                    <br>
                    So, <span>WHY</span> on earth would we make this? <br>
                    Politics aside, most people would agree that Donald could say some outlandish things. 
                    Now that he's served as a President, all of his tweets are historical documents. 
                    Future generations may come to study some of Trumps writings in textbooks, or whatever platform schools may use to teach students. <br>

                <p class="text_left_alignment"> 
                    -You play 5x rounds, with each round presenting two tweets. One is Trumps, the other is random. <br>
                    -<span>CLICK</span> the tweet you think is Trumps. <br>
                    -In order to win, score 5/5 <br>
                    -A <span>STREAK</span> is formed by getting a win, and can continue as long as the player gets all guesses correct. <br>
                    -A <span>STREAK</span> is broken by getting one or more tweets wrong each game. 
                    -If one of the first four tweets is guessed incorrectly, you have the reset option at the top right to start that game again. <br>
                    -Restarting won't ruin your streak, but it will show you new tweets.

                    Trumpter’s client side consists of <span>HTML</span>, <span>Javascript</span>, and <span>CSS</span>. <br>
                    <br>
                    Using <span>HTML</span> for structuring the page, the <span>DOM</span> content is easily modified as required for gameplay. <br>
                    <br>
                    <span>CSS</span> is used to make the website look appealing, while also providing functionality such as animations & 
                    adjusting the placement/sizing of elements depending on the webpage width. <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, <span>JS</span> provides core functionality & game logic. 
                    There’s no <span>JS</span> included in the <span>HTML</span> such as buttons with “onclick()” - 
                    as this is replaced by mouselistener events implemented over DIVs. 
                    <span>JS</span> variables actively hold the score, call new tweets, populate tweets, and manipulate the <span>DOM</span> as needed.

                    Trumpters early designs featured this colour scheme, but as both of us preferred dark mode on our browsers 
                    (dark mode is ineffective on files) we opted to create the whole website to be less harsh on the eyes. <br>
                    For Tweets, a pristine white such as rgb(255, 255, 255) would be used in tandem with a grey such as #b9b9b9. 
                    Content outside the tweets would employ a soft off-white colouring and a tasteful thickness on the border/margin lines. <br>
                    For these reasons, the classic white twitter look would have been a perfect match for an alternative website theme. <br>

                                ~Advantages~ <br>
                            -Faster to load a website, and less stress on server side resources <br>

                            -Enables tracking of users through techniques such as GPU fingerprinting (timing how long it takes to run a specific Jscript animation) <br>
                                ~Disadvantages~ <br>
                            -Without proper server side checks in place, users can manipulate data that will be sent back to the server (modifying game scores, ect) <br>
                            -Anyone with the ability to press "F12" has the ability to see the webpage and JS source code.

                            -Incredibly difficult for users to skew results (compared to modifying the local client JS) <br>
                            -Less content and bandwidth required for users with poor internet connections <br>
                            -Better for SEO (search engine optimisation) <br>
                            -Inner workings of website code are obfuscated. <br>
                                ~Disadvantages~ <br>
                            -Running scripts on your server sucks up resources. In the event of a DDOS or Slowloris attack, this is significantly leveraged
                            making it easier to perform these attacks. <br>
                            -Pages need to be refreshed to show new content, compared to a Javascript DOM manipulation live.

                    The server side architecture is almost entirely built from packages associated with Flask. <br>
                    -A python file dedicated to routes connects webpage requests with the associated content. <br> 
                    -SQLAlchemy allows access to the database, which contains tweets, user data, and accounts. <br>
                    -Flask logins suppport the account creation & logins. This also validates the email input, and <br>
                    makes the passwords stored a SHA-256 hash instead of plaintext.

                    -Define what can and can <span>NOT</span> be cached. The majority of content posted from the server is static (such as tweets), which is fine to cache.  <br>
                    -On the other hand, dynamic/encrypted content regarding the current user such as their game data cannot be cached.  <br>
                    -Set up a POST method for users to submit tweets (currently set to admins) <br>
                    -Set up dynamic webhosting that can adjust depending on users.  <br>

                    In order to develop the website, my group partner and I would hire either a full stack developer or solely backend, and work alongside them. <br>
                    Since the website is basic, the budget would be around ~$15,000. This would involve a month of working with a developer, and enough money to keep 
                    the server afloat for 3-6 months with a small-medium user base (up to 10,000 daily users). <br>
                    During this period the ad revenue from the users would either keep the website afloat or sink it. <br>
                    The two of us would then voluntarily maintain and update the site. <br>

                    ~Functional testing~ <br>
                    -Identify how the feature should interact. <br>
                    -Test its resource intensivity. Adjust as needed. <br>
                    -How the feature interacts with the rest of the application. <br>
                    -How the feature works on different browsers & devices. <br>

                    ~Usability testing~ <br>
                    -Test how the feature works with edge cases. <br>
                    -Check if any security flaws arise with the application <br>
                    <br>
                    In order to perform these kinds of testing, Selenium is a suitable match for the front end. 
                    The development team can run the tests at high speeds, and get full coverage of the front end for what a user can interact with. <br>
                    When it comes to backend, Pythons unit test module covers most bases, 
                    and is much simpler to implement than other methods as the backend is already created in python.

                    The timeline of Trumpter looked like this: <br>
                    -Brainstorm the idea, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0q99zSp3C4vyL56ixfLLxQGhZSP_4vG/view">and develop it on paper</a> <br>
                    -Find reliable sources for tweets. <br>
                    -Develop a basic functional version of the website with only JS, HTML, and CSS. <br>
                    -Refine the website's front end with more CSS.<br>
                    -Start backend by creating a basic working session, where the client requests the HTML, Javascript, and CSS. <br>
                    -Create a backend sql server, which contains tables for users, statistics, and trump/non trump tweets respectively. <br>
                    -Break the HTML up into small templates, sent as required. <br>
                    -Create a route for account creation/logins, and requesting tweets. <br>
                    -Set up an SQLAlchemy request that gets a random tweet from one of the tweet tables. <br>
                    -Add more tweets to the database. <br>
                    -Adjust client side JS to request a new tweet each round. <br>
                    -Create Jquery request for user statistics (not completely implemented by the due date). <br>
                    <br>
                    I had no issues working alongside Kyron, my group partner. Although this was the first time working together, 
                    we had the same expectations for the assignment and dedicated an equal amount of time to executing it. <br>
                    The only change I would make doing this in the future is adding more people to the group, 
                    as although our website was fairly basic we ended up having some features come out of scope to get the assignment in on time.
